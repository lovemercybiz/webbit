# Webbit

A _nearly_ full-feature (okay not really..ðŸ˜†) Reddit clone built with Ruby on Rails. This app is the result of a course called Hello Rails found at [hellorails.io](https://hellorails.io).

<!-- ## Required dependencies

This is a modern Ruby on Rails application. Please use [this guide](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.14-mojave) to install both Ruby and Rails on a Mac and [this guide](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) to install on a PC (using Windows 10).

You may notice in the screen casts I make use of a beta version of Rails. You _may_ need to do the same or be lucky enough to experience a full release of Rails 6 by the time you read this. The guides above will only tell you how to install the latest full release of Rails so assuming Rails 6 is out yet you will need to install Rails with a pre-release flag:  `$ gem install rails --prerelease`.

_In the screen casts I approached this in a different order but installing the pre-release first will provide a smoother experience. If you want to follow along with the videos thats perfectly fine as well._

This course currently makes use of:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Git - `$ brew install git`
- Rails `6.0.0.rc1`
- Ruby `2.5+` - `2.6.3` to be exact.
- Bundler `2.0+`  - If you don't have run `$ gem install bundler:2.0.1`
- PostgreSQL - `$ brew install postgresql` or [Postgres.app - a GUI interface](https://postgresapp.com/)

### First time boot up

When first launching the app (`$ rails server`) you be prompted to run `$ bundle install`. This will fetch dependencies/gems required for the app to launch. This app also makes use of `Node.js` dependencies so you'll likely need to install yarn `$ brew install yarn` and then run `$ yarn` after `cd`-ing into the project root directory. When in doubt follow the feedback that outputs in the terminal or [contact me](https://hellorails.io/contact/new).

## Modeling for Webbit
